About Moon Highway
======
Moon Highway is a training and curriculum development company based in Northern
California. Our goal in every course is to build confidence by challenging students
to succeed. We create an environment that nurtures success in every classroom for
students at every skill level. We believe that success is contagious. The excitement
that we build with one small group of engineers will permeate your entire organization.

## Who We Train
We teach JavaScript to __technical professionals__. We migrate __engineers__ from traditional
object oriented languages to JavaScript. We upgrade current JavaScript __developers__ to
the latest techniques and practices. We teach __creatives__ how to be more effective with
JavaScript and CSS. We even provide classes for __managers__ and __non-technical stakeholders__,
so they can understand how everything fits together. We can teach your __entire team__ how
to build JavaScript applications that run on a server, in a browser, on a phone, on a robot,
or in virtual reality.

## Who we are
Moon Highway is a family business. Alex Banks and Eve Porcello are instructors,
curriculum designers, authors, and partners both in business and in life.

What makes us unique
=============================

## Experience
Alex developed his first website in 1995. We started teaching full stack web development during the first dot com boom. We
were writing JavaScript code before there was AJAX. We watched the internet, and JavaScript, mature over the years.
Through all of it, we were in the classroom.

## Knowledge
Instead of teaching every language, we focus specifically on JavaScript. We build our apps using JavaScript. Reducing our scope of courses to JavaScript allows us to dive deep
into this community and remain on the cutting edge of the most popular programming language in the world.

## Focus
Moon Highway classes are not about us, they are about you. It's not what we can do with JavaScript, or
what we know about web development, it's about weather or not you can get the job done. Our classes are not
all day lectures. They are all day hack-a-thons. We train engineers as if they are going to come work on our team.

## Materials
We think a lot about training and training materials. We've come up with a modular approach to course content that allows us to customize each class to the needs of a specific team. We treat our content like software. All of our course files are hosted in GitHub and we update them continuously.

We've even standardized how we approach to content development. All of our course content falls under one of the following categories:

<div id="template-1" class="template">
  <div>
    <h3>Samples</h3>
    <p>are small, simplified, reduced, chunks of code designed to illustrate a concept.
  Samples are executable, students can modify and run the code. Sometimes the best way
  to learn is to change something in a sample as see how that effects the output.</p>
  </div>
  <figure>

      <img src="/img/about/samples.png" alt="pure function sample" />
    </a>  
    <figcaption>Sample: Pure Functions<figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<div id="template-2" class="template">
  <div>
    <h3>Topics</h3>
    <p>Topics consist of a collection of samples along with some materials to
  help facilitate teaching a concept. The facilitating materials typically employ
  analogy and may use animations or media.</p>
  </div>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/about/topics.png" alt="Periodic table of JavaScript" />
    <figcaption>Topic: JavaScript Periodic table</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<div id="template-3" class="template">
  <div>
    <h3>Labs</h3>
    <p>Labs are challenges that are presented to the student as requirements, specifications,
  and sometimes wireframes. Labs are typically small enough for a student to complete in roughly 30 minutes.
  They are designed to get students solving problems themselves, with their own code.</p>
  </div>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/about/star-rating.png" alt="star rating" />
    <figcaption>Lab: Build a Star Rating Component</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<div id="template-4" class="template">
  <div>
    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <p>are longer activities that are designed to simulate a real world implementation of a topic. Exercises
  consist of iterations where students complete tasks step by step together as a class typically to complete
  an application.</p>  
  </div>
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/about/exercise.png" alt="using redux in an app" />
    <figcaption>Exercise: Creating a Graph View</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Our courses are structured using a combination of these techniques. Samples introduce
a technique, labs challenge the student to implement that technique on their own,
and exercises give us a feel for how to implement that technique in the real world.
This process leverages the power of reinforcement and is designed to build student confidence.

Online Content
==============
Since 2015, we’ve created several classes as LinkedIn Learning authors. Although our classroom
materials go into greater detail these online courses are a great way to get a feel for our
presentation style.
