About Moon Highway
======

Moon Highway is a training and curriculum development company based in Tahoe City, California. Our goal in every course is to deliver hands-on, immediately relatable content for engineering teams.

## Who We Train
We teach engineering teams how to build powerful applications with the latest technologies.

Whether it’s a project manager who needs to know more about HTML, a front-end engineer who needs to know the latest JavaScript, or a back-end developer who is ready to finally fall in love with JavaScript, we’ll deliver an engaging course that meets everyone’s needs.

## Why Our Classes are Different

### Quality Content
We create and maintain all of our own content. With our Github repositories, all of our samples, exercises, and labs are open-source projects where we make changes as technologies evolve.

### Expert Knowledge
Our trainers are our curriculum developers, so they have first-hand knowledge of all of the course contents. They also dig deep into the languages and libraries that they teach to understand the features and avoid the problems. We don’t teach every technology - we focus on the ones that we know out and out.

### Collaborative Approach
We care a lot about helping our students succeed. An instructor is not just a technology expert who covers the bullet points and hopes people can keep up. An instructor should facilitate a collaborative effort. We listen to the needs of the students in real-time to make students feel engaged and supported when learning something new.

## Curriculum Development
Over two decades of teaching programming courses, we've developed a standard approach to courseware that focuses more on hands-on training and less on lecture.

Our course materials contain several different components: samples, topics, exercises, and labs.

### Samples
Samples are short code examples that introduce a new concept.

### Topics
Several samples together comprise a topic, a content area that is covered throughout the day.

### Labs
are where we challenge students to see what they have retained. Usually starting from a list of requirements, the students work on these tiny projects independently or with pair programming. This allows students to work hands-on to solve a problem that they might face in their day to day work.
