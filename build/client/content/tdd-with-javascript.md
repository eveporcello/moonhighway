Test-Driven Development with JavaScript
=======

## Length: 1 Day

Red. Green. Gold. Write the test. Make it pass. Make it better.

With test-driven development, a developer writes the tests first to ensure that the product will be well documented and solidly built. In this course, we'll cover the features of test-driven development and will get students writing and passing tests with JavaScript test libraries.

### What You'll Learn

* Intro to Test-Driven Development
* Understanding Code Complexity
* Writing Unit Tests with Jest (or your testing library of choice)
* Isolating the System Under Test
* Working with Test Doubles
* Setting Up Test Automation

## Prerequisites
Students will be most successful in this class if they know HTML and basic JavaScript types like objects, functions, and arrays. Some Node.js knowledge would be useful also.
