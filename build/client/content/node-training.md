      This course is designed for __developers__, __engineers__, __creatives__, and __managers__
      who have never had the chance to learn the core fundamentals of vanilla JavaScript.
      This course examines the core types available in JavaScript and how these types are used
      to create every library, framework, or application that uses the language. We examine
      JavaScript's quirks and discuss how JavaScript differs from other programming languages. Students
      leave this course with a solid understanding of the basics of vanilla JavaScript and
      become more confident at their jobs.
