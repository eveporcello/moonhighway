With JavaScript and Node.js training from Moon Highway, you'll learn the skills necessary to be a successful full-stack JavaScript developer.

Our beginner JavaScript courses emphasize the fundamentals of JavaScript for engineers that are new to front end development. Since JavaScript seems to be involved in every level of the stack, we'll make sure that everyone is up to speed on the latest techniques. Or, if the basics are already in place for your developers, we'll cover Node.js and the ecosystem of tools. From the file system to npm to testing, developers will be able to hit the ground running with Node projects.
