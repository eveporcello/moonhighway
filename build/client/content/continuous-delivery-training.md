Continuous Delivery Training
=========

Continuous Delivery is the practice of deploying your code to production without
any human intervention. It allows your business products to rapidly incorporate
feedback and instantly push new features to production without compromising quality.
The JavaScript community has plenty of tools that we can use to build continuous delivery
pipelines. Our courses are geared towards students who want to master the patterns
and tools associated with JavaScript build pipelines.
